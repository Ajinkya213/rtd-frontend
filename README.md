## Real-Time Speedometer with React and Socket.IO

This React application displays real-time speed data on a speedometer using Socket.IO for communication with a backend server. 

## Functionality

- Connects to a backend server using Socket.IO.
- Continuously receives real-time speed data from the server.
- Updates a speedometer component (`react-speedometer`) with the received speed data, providing a visual representation.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
- A running backend server that transmits real-time speed data through Socket.IO.

### Setup

1. **Clone or download the repository.**
2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   (or `yarn install`)

### Running the Application

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   (or `yarn start`)

2. This will start the React application in development mode, usually running at `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Technology Stack

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Socket.IO:** Library for real-time, two-way communication between browsers and servers.
- **react-speedometer:** React component library for creating speedometer visualizations.

## Expected Behavior

- Upon starting the application, you should see a speedometer component.
- If successfully connected to the backend server, the speedometer needle will respond to real-time speed data updates from the server.
